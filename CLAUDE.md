# CLAUDE.md

Project-specific guardrails. **Read every section before touching this repo.**

## Release process — MANDATORY

This app ships via Sparkle auto-update. Get any of this wrong and you brick auto-update for everyone who's already installed.

### The loop (3 commands)

```sh
echo "X.Y.Z" > VERSION                                # 1. Bump
git commit -am "chore(release): bump VERSION to X.Y.Z" \
  && git tag vX.Y.Z                                   # 2. Commit + tag
git push origin main vX.Y.Z                           # 3. Push (fires CI)
```

That's it. CI does **everything else** in ~1.5 min:

- Builds the universal DMG
- Signs it with the EdDSA key from the `SPARKLE_ED_PRIVATE_KEY` secret
- Generates `appcast.xml` listing the new version
- Uploads DMG + appcast as release assets

Watch with `gh run watch --exit-status` if you want confirmation, or just trust it.

### Hard rules — break these and you brick auto-update

1. **`VERSION` must be a single-monotonic version like `0.0.X`, NOT `1` or `100` or anything weird.** `build.sh` uses `$VERSION` as both `CFBundleVersion` and `CFBundleShortVersionString`. Sparkle compares `CFBundleVersion` of the running app against `sparkle:version` in the appcast using Apple's component-wise comparator — so `"1"` parses as `[1]` and is **larger than** `"0.0.99"`. Stay in semver. Always increase.

2. **The Sparkle public key in `build.sh` (`SU_PUBLIC_KEY="6WJH..."`) must NEVER be changed casually.** Every existing install verifies updates against this exact key. Change it and every prior install rejects every future update silently. The matching private key lives in (a) the maintainer's macOS Keychain under service `https://sparkle-project.org` and (b) the `SPARKLE_ED_PRIVATE_KEY` GitHub Actions secret. To rotate, see the migration note in `docs/SPARKLE.md` (TL;DR: don't).

3. **Never edit appcast XML files by hand.** The appcast is a release asset built by `release.sh` from the signed DMG. Hand-edits invalidate the EdDSA signature.

4. **Never commit `Vendor/`.** It's gitignored. The `bin/sign_update`, `bin/generate_keys`, etc. binaries live there for local use; CI re-vendors via `scripts/setup-sparkle.sh`.

### CI secrets (one-time, already configured)

This GitHub Actions secret exists on the `agent-island` repo:

- **`SPARKLE_ED_PRIVATE_KEY`** — the EdDSA private key. Without it CI fails at the signing step.

If it is rotated, regenerate via the original instructions in `docs/SPARKLE.md`.

### Smoke-testing the update prompt locally

If you want to verify Sparkle's UI before tagging:

```sh
./release.sh                  # produces dist/Gauge-X.Y.Z.dmg + dist/appcast.xml
                              # (uses Keychain key — no env vars needed locally)
```

The local `release.sh` is identical to CI except for asset upload. To force-trigger an update prompt without publishing: temporarily change `SUFeedURL` in `build.sh` to point at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/appcast.xml`, serve `dist/appcast.xml` from there with `python3 -m http.server 8765`, run with a lower local `VERSION` than the appcast advertises, hit Check Now.

To build with auto-update **disabled** (debug copies): `SU_FEED_URL= ./build.sh`.

### Things that have already broken and how they were fixed

History — read before re-stepping on these rakes:

| Problem | Symptom | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CFBundleVersion = "1"` hardcoded | Sparkle never sees any update as newer | `"1"` > `"0.0.X"` in component-wise comparison | `build.sh` now sets it to `$VERSION` |
| `SUPublicEDKey` empty in CI builds | Sparkle silently rejects every signed update | Public key was in gitignored `Vendor/` only | Public key hardcoded in `build.sh` |
| `xattr -d` non-recursive in cask postflight | "Updater failed to start" on first Check Now | Quarantine attr remained on Sparkle's nested `Updater.app` | `xattr -dr` (recursive) |
| `--no-quarantine` in install docs | `brew install` fails with "switch is disabled" | Homebrew removed the flag in late 2025 | Cask postflight strips the attr; flag removed from docs |
| `…` after `$VAR` in shell scripts | CI fails with `unbound variable` | Non-UTF-8 locale on runners makes bash include trailing bytes in identifier | Use `${VAR}…` braces, or stick to ASCII in echo strings |
| Old yonsei email in commits | Vercel rejected landing deploys | Local git config used unverified email | Set `git config user.email` to a GitHub-verified address before committing |
| Landing tried to read `../VERSION` | Vercel build ENOENT'd at `/vercel/VERSION` | Landing is its own repo; Vercel only checks out `codex-island-landing`, so `..` escapes the build root | Landing has its own `VERSION` file, read with `path.join(process.cwd(), "VERSION")` — sync it on every release |
| Claude usage chip showing `HTTP 403` | Existing installs stop showing real numbers post-upgrade | Anthropic added `user:profile` to the required scope set on `/api/oauth/usage` (mid-2026) — pre-upgrade keychain tokens only carry `user:inference` | User runs `claude /login` to re-mint with the new scope set; app surfaces "re-login: claude /login" instead of raw HTTP code |
| Refresh URL pinned to `console.anthropic.com` | Refresh path silently 404s on tokens minted by current CLI | OAuth issuer migrated to `platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token`; old host is no longer the canonical issuer | Refresh URL bumped to `platform.claude.com` |

## Architecture pointers

- `Sources/Window/IslandWindowController.swift` — borderless overlay window. Listens to `NSApplication.didChangeScreenParametersNotification` to reposition on display changes; prefers the screen with `safeAreaInsets.top > 0` (the notched display).
- `Sources/Update/UpdaterController.swift` — wraps Sparkle's `SPUStandardUpdaterController`. Reads `SUFeedURL` / `SUPublicEDKey` from Info.plist (injected by `build.sh`). Auto-check state is stored by Sparkle itself in `NSUserDefaults` under `SU*` keys.
- `Sources/Usage/UsageFetcher.swift` — Codex (`/wham/usage`) and Claude (`/api/oauth/usage`) fetchers. Claude requires the `claude-code/X.Y.Z` User-Agent + `oauth-2025-04-20` beta header. Refresh-token rotation is wired through `writeClaudeCreds` — Anthropic rotates the refresh token on every call and the keychain MUST be updated, or downstream consumers (Claude Code, Claude Desktop) 401. Refresh URL is `https://platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token` (migrated from `console.anthropic.com`). The endpoint also requires the `user:profile` scope as of mid-2026 — tokens from older logins return 403 and the only fix is `claude /login` (refresh re-issues with the same scope set).
- `Sources/Usage/AppUsage.swift` — `plan` field carries Claude's `subscriptionType` (from keychain) or Codex's `plan_type` (from API top-level). Surfaced as the chip badge in `SettingsView` + `UsageView`.

## Build details

- `build.sh` — universal binary (arm64 + x86_64 via `lipo`), macOS 13+, ad-hoc codesign, embeds Sparkle.framework with `@executable_path/../Frameworks` rpath.
- Unsigned by Apple — no $99 Developer ID. The ad-hoc sign is just to dodge "is damaged and can't be opened" Gatekeeper rejection on download. Sparkle's EdDSA signing handles update integrity independently.
- `scripts/setup-sparkle.sh` downloads Sparkle 2.9.1 into `Vendor/Sparkle/` (idempotent). Runs automatically as part of `build.sh`.

## What NOT to change without explicit user request

- The `5m / 15m / 30m` polling presets (`Sources/Model/RefreshIntervalStore.swift`) — Anthropic rate-limits aggressively. Anything below 5m burns the daily quota.
- The `claude-code/X.Y.Z` User-Agent string — Anthropic gates `/api/oauth/usage` on it. Without it, requests 401 even with a valid token.
- The bundle ID `dev.agentisland.AgentIsland` — changing it orphans every existing user's preferences and Launch-at-Login registration.
- The `SU_PUBLIC_KEY` constant in `build.sh`. See hard rule #2.

## `docs/` vs `notes/` — what gets committed

This repo is public open source. `docs/` is for things a contributor or
curious user would read. `notes/` is gitignored and is for maintainer-only
operational material. **When in doubt, default to `notes/`** — it's
trivial to promote a file later, painful to scrub git history.

**`docs/` (committed, public):**
- Build / release / signing process (e.g. `SPARKLE.md`).
- Architecture deep-dives, protocol notes, contributor onboarding.
- Anything that helps someone reading the source understand it or ship a PR.

**`notes/` (gitignored, maintainer-only) — examples of what belongs here:**
- Launch / marketing playbooks (where to post, when to post, UTM schemas, channel-by-channel rules).
- Analytics & traffic ops (PostHog dashboards, GitHub traffic API workflows, install-funnel telemetry, dashboard URLs).
- Anything mentioning private infra: tokens, secret names, dashboard IDs, internal cron schedules — even if the secret value isn't there, the *shape* of the deployment is.
- Personal launch-strategy retrospectives, growth experiments, A/B copy drafts.

**Heuristic:** if removing the file from the public repo would *embarrass*
nothing and *help* nobody outside the maintainer, it belongs in `notes/`.
If it would actively help a contributor or a downstream packager, it
belongs in `docs/`.

When creating a new doc in this category, do **not** add it to `docs/` and
later move it — moving leaves a deletion in history that still shows the
title and intent. Create it in `notes/` from the start.

## Style

- Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`. No `Co-Authored-By` lines.
- Strict TypeScript / Swift — no `any`, no force-unwraps without justification.
- Default to no comments. Only add when the WHY is non-obvious (a constraint, a workaround for a specific bug, behavior that would surprise a reader).
- Match existing style in the file you're editing, even if you'd do it differently.

## Windows port (windows/)

The WPF port lives in `windows/` (monorepo since v1.4.1-era; history subtree-merged
from the retired agent-island-windows repo). Rules:
- One tag releases BOTH platforms: `.github/workflows/windows-release.yml` waits for
  the macOS job's release (which carries the Sparkle appcast) before attaching
  `AgentIsland-<version>-win-x64.zip`. Never create a Windows-only non-prerelease
  release — it would occupy `releases/latest` without appcast.xml and break every
  Mac user's auto-update.
- Windows binary version comes from the shared `VERSION` file at release time
  (`build.ps1 -Version`); the csproj version is only a dev fallback.
- macOS release flow (build.sh / release.sh / VERSION / Sparkle keys) is unchanged
  and remains the source of truth for `releases/latest`.
